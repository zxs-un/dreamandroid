/**
 * Language-agnostic character-presence bitmap used to pre-filter fuzzy
 * candidates. Every character is hashed into one of [WIDTH] bits; an entry's
 * bitmap ORs the bits of all its characters. A pattern can only be a subsequence
 * of a text if every pattern bit is also set in the text bitmap, so
 * `(entry & query) == query` cheaply rejects the vast majority of non-matches
 * before the O(len) subsequence scan runs.
 *
 * Hash collisions only ever weaken the filter (false positives that fall through
 * to the real check); they can never drop a genuine match. Because it hashes raw
 * code units instead of assuming an alphabet, it works the same for Latin, CJK,
 * Cyrillic or any other script — which matters since the translation dictionary
 * may be in any language.
